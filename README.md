# Not-A-BasketballRef-Scraper
An in the works scraper for Sports-Reference. Goal is to be able to collect all sorts of sports data quickly and easily right from the terminal. Currently working on NBA and NFL data.
<p>Started with the need to collect data for a university project. </p> I will try to get this working with
lots of different data tables so that others
can easily clone this repo and get to collecting the data they need without so much hassle.
Other scrapers exist to collect data from the website, however I've noticed some features have not been working and do not get updated.
<p>Collects data into csv format.</p>
